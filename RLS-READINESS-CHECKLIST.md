# RLS Readiness Checklist ✅

## 🚀 Quick Verification (5 minutes)

### 1. Run the Testing Script
```sql
-- Copy this into your Supabase SQL editor
\i test-rls-implementation.sql
```

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] All tables show "✅ ENABLED" for RLS
- [ ] Each table has multiple policies
- [ ] Helper functions exist
- [ ] Auth_id column exists (if using Option A)

### 2. Check User Mapping Status
```sql
SELECT id, email, auth_id, role, site FROM public.users ORDER BY id;
```

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Users have auth_id values (if using Option A)
- [ ] Or users have NULL auth_id (if using Option B)

### 3. Test Authentication
```sql
SELECT auth.uid() as current_user_auth_id;
```

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Returns a UUID (if logged in)
- [ ] Returns NULL (if not logged in)

## 🧪 Application Testing (10 minutes)

### 4. Test Your App Login
- [ ] Log in to your application
- [ ] Verify you can see your profile
- [ ] Check that data access works normally

### 5. Test Site Isolation
- [ ] Verify you only see data from your site
- [ ] Confirm you cannot access other sites' data

### 6. Test Role Permissions
- [ ] **As Regular User**: Can only see own data
- [ ] **As Staff**: Can manage cafe orders for site
- [ ] **As Admin**: Can manage everything for site

## 🚨 Common Issues to Watch For

### If you see "No rows returned":
- [ ] Check if user is mapped to auth_id
- [ ] Verify user is authenticated
- [ ] Check user role and site assignment

### If you see "Permission denied":
- [ ] Verify RLS policies are created
- [ ] Check user permissions
- [ ] Ensure helper functions exist

### If your app stops working:
- [ ] Check if RLS is blocking legitimate access
- [ ] Verify user mapping is correct
- [ ] Test with different user roles

## ✅ Success Indicators

Your RLS implementation is working if:

- [ ] **Database queries work** without errors
- [ ] **Users can log in** and access their data
- [ ] **Site isolation works** (users only see their site)
- [ ] **Role permissions work** (different access levels)
- [ ] **Your application functions** normally
- [ ] **No unauthorized access** to other users' data

## 🔧 If Something's Wrong

### Quick Fixes:

1. **Re-run the RLS script**:
   ```sql
   \i fix-user-auth-mapping.sql
   ```

2. **Map users to auth IDs**:
   ```sql
   UPDATE public.users SET auth_id = auth.uid() WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
   ```

3. **Check RLS status**:
   ```sql
   SELECT tablename, rowsecurity FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = 'public';
   ```

4. **Verify policies**:
   ```sql
   SELECT tablename, policyname FROM pg_policies WHERE schemaname = 'public';
   ```

## 🎯 Final Status

- [ ] **RLS Implementation**: ✅ Complete
- [ ] **Testing**: ✅ Verified
- [ ] **User Mapping**: ✅ Done
