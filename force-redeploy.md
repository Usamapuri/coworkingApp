# Force Redeploy - Database Connection Fix

This file was created to trigger a Vercel redeploy with the correct database environment variables.

## Issue
- Vercel deployment was using old database URL: `api.pooler.supabase.com`
- Correct URL: `aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com`
- Environment variables have been updated in Vercel dashboard

## Solution
- Updated local .env file with correct Supabase project details
- Vercel environment variables are now correct
- This commit will trigger a new deployment

## Next Steps
1. Commit this file
2. Push to trigger Vercel redeploy
3. Test login functionality
